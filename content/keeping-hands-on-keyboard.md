I'm trying to memorize and get used to keeping my hands on the keyboard using various key binding on my Linux setup

This is my reference guide that you can use too

# Linux

1. I use the `ctrl + tab` key combination to quickly change between windows that it's ingrained into my memory right now

2. `super + tab` is the alternative to navigate between windows in different workspaces. I rarely use it, but it sometimes comes in handy when working on different projects at the same time.

3. Finally, `super + d` is used to get a general overview of a particular workspace I am in.

Below is a video demonstration

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<video width="500" height="full" controls>
  <source src="/keeping-hands-off-keyboard/window-switching.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>

## VS Code

Next is the key binding that I've grown accustomed to on VS Code

-   `ctrl + p` to quickly switch between different files in my project.

-   `ctrl + t` to search for symbols across my entire project.

-   `ctrl + shift + o` to search for symbols such as class/function names, object field names in the file I am editing, e.t.c

-   `ctrl + g` to open up a prompt where I can enter a specific line number to navigate to.

-   `ctrl + r` to open a previously opened project in a new VS Code window.

-   `ctrl + shift + f` to search for a phrase or word in all files in my project.

-   `ctrl + b` to close / open my side bar.

For all of you that have exquisite taste, the title is a play of the famous and somewhat critically acclaimed anime series [Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!

I'll probably expand this by doing a full post on my VS Code, Zed and Linux setup in the future.
